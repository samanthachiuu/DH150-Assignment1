Myucla.edu is the UCLA system for students to enroll in their classes. Craigslist is a selling and buying website where people can buy anything they desire and a website for finding jobs and events. My motivation and relevance for improving these websites is that I want to prove to myself that I can do this, and I can think like a designer. I will motivate myself to learn as much as I can and to think about what the user experience means. My motivation for myucla.edu is that I want to help other new students with any challenges they had when they first registered for classes. I definitely had a hard time as a freshman, and no one taught me anything, so I want to do this for any new users. My motivation for improving Craigslist is for my family and my close friends because everyone around me uses this website. If I was able to improve the user experience, they would have a better time browsing through the website without having any issues. I specifically chose to do myucla.edu and the process of enrolling for classes because I feel like this is something a lot of students go through and struggle with from the beginning. I chose to do Craigslist because it is something I personally have been using when I was browsing for a car and noticed little user issues that I wish the website could be better at. Overall, both websites are not too awful, as many people use both of these websites on a daily basis. However, there are little things that can be improved for these websites and can make even more users be inclined to the website. 

1. Visibility of system status 

Always keep users informed about what is going on.

Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

Example: Battery status, network status

Evaluation
Prototype 1: 

* You have to login into your account for myucla before you can get into the class planner. (1)

* Does a good job with giving the user an option to either add the class into the planner or to enroll ~ however, users might not know what the difference is. (1)

* You have to use DUO login to login into the account (for example, you have to use your phone number that is connected to the account or have the app on your phone). (3) 

Prototype 2:

* Does not have to make an account when searching on the website – but needs an account if you want to purchase something. (1)

* There is a calendar on the side column to show users which days they want to see because each days might have different listings. (1)

Both:

* Both websites needed user to create an account if actually wanted to perform any action – and shows you that you are on your account clearly. 

2. Match between system and the real world 

Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 

Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 
Example: Right-left sign  

Evaluation
Prototype 1:

* People might not understand what “Degree Audit Report” means, but you need to go into that in order to figure out what classes to take. (2)

* Using words like “enroll” because people understand what that means and what it will do.(1)

* Does not know what PTE means. (2)

Prototype 2:

* The different categories on the website mean exactly what they mean in real life. (1)

Both: For the most part, does a great job in trying to connect the system functions to what users would understand. 

3. User control and freedom 

Users often choose system functions by mistake.

Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 

Support undo and redo. 
Example: No exit

Evaluation
Prototype 1:

* Gives the user the option to cancel when in the process of enrolling in the class. (1)

* If user accidentally chooses a class that they did not mean to choose, they cannot choose another but has to let it load out the classes that you chose first. (2)

* Does not allow user to go back or it will tell you to log back in and start over. (3)

Prototype 2:

* Can use the back button on the website. (1)

* Does a great job in giving the user an option to exit if wanted to. (1)

Both: Allows user to cancel or get out of the website if wanted to. For example, can just exit out of the page. 

4. Consistency and standards 

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 

Follow platform conventions.
Example: button label (login), function of icon (go back home), location of the icon/menu/layout 

Evaluation
Prototype 1:

* Using similar words in the website like “enrollment”, or “enroll” consistently so users know what it means. (1)

* Process of enrolling in one class is the same as enrolling in other classes. (1)

* Users might not know what “subject area” means, but this is the easiest way for how you register for your classes. (3)

* Users do not know what fiat luxes are – and does not explain anywhere on the website when registering for the classes. (3)

* However, when figuring out what to do the first time, everything else is the same and it can be easier for users to do again. (1)

Prototype 2:

* When clicking on subheadings, it brings you to the page ~ the buttons are consistent in what it does. (1)

* The words are consistent, with “owner” or “dealer”(1)

* Location of the home page is in the same area so it is easy for users to remember (1)

* Uses a bunch of different abbreviations that users might not know or understand what it means. (3)

Both: Some words are not clear to user what it means and can cause users to not understand how to navigate the website. 

5. Error prevention 

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 
Example: booking system that prevents the previous date to the departure, warning message about duplicated filename, password setting 

Evaluation
Prototype 1: 

* Myucla does not allow user to enroll in a class if they have no completed prerequisites ~warning pops up (1)

* If there is a time conflict with a class, myucla gives a warning before user proceeds (1)

* Even though some classes have time conflicts, myucla still allows student to enroll. (2)

Prototype 2:

* User has to fill in required fields for listing in order for the listing to be posted. (1)

Both: They have put restrictions on some functions to prevent users from errors. 

6. Recognition rather than recall 

Make objects, actions, and options visible. 

User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 

Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 
Example: 404 error (code errors), autofill

Evaluation
Prototype 1:
* After figuring out what is class planner and its functions, it is very easy for the user to recognize the other controls and register for other classes. (1)
* There is autofill when user is typing in the classes which makes it easier for user to find the class. (1)
* User needs to remember where their DARS report is in order to know what classes to take. (3)
* User needs to go to bruinwalk on a separate website and keep going back and forth to check professor and class ratings. (2)

Prototype 2: 
* Website does not have any tutorials, so user might not know how to post a new listing on the website. (2)
* Does not have autofill or does not recognize wrongly typed words in search – so it has to match exactly the listing. (3)

Both: Does not have tutorials or walk throughs on the website. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 

Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 

Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
Example: short cut, copy + paste 

Evaluation
Prototype 1:
* There are two ways to register for classes, and someone who is advanced and knows what they are doing will find classes through class planner, while a novice user might use “find a class and enroll” tab. (2)
* Myucla makes users have to go into their DARS report, in a totally different tab and part of the website to find out which classes they need to take – and then have to go back to class planner to see if they offer the class. (3)
* Finding the ratings of the class and professor is also in another website that users have to be on. (2)

Prototype 2:
* There are no shortcuts in the website – every user has to click through the same steps to post a listing or look for specific listings. (1)
* Provides pull down bars on the top of the page, so users can change the location or topic of the item they are trying to find. (1)

Both: The websites are catered towards people who have been on the website before. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 

Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
Example: bad background design

Evaluation

Prototype 1: 
* They use different colors for the different classes you register for. (1)
* Hard to tell the difference between enrolled classes and classes on your plan. (3)
* The Need Help page is in bright yellow and everything else on the page is blue, therefore making the contrast easy to see where the help is. (1)
* Font and colors and design of page is not very eye appealing and looks very boring. (3)
* Nothing memorable on the page. (3)

Prototype 2:
* Boring colors and fonts – everything looks the same and cannot tell what is important or what is not. (3)
* Prices on the listings are so small that user cannot really see what it says. (3)

Both: Both websites have too minimalistic designs that show no originality to their websites. Both have tight filled spaces. 

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 

Expressed in plain language (no codes)

Precisely indicate the problem

Constructively suggest a solution. 
Example: required field*, internet connection warning, (404 error)

Evaluation

Prototype 1:
* When there is a time conflict with another class or if there is a pre-requisite for the class, there is an orange cone symbol that pops up to show that there could be a possible error. (1)
* If you do not check all boxes before enrolling for the class, it will not let users enroll. (1)
* Sometimes website freezes if internet connection dies and does not recover itself. (2)
* Help center is not available 24 hours of the day and can cause difficultly forr users that use the website on the weekend. (2)

Prototype 2:
* Cannot tell the difference between a scammed listing and a regular listing, and therefore it does not help users diagnose any errors. (3)
* Allows pictures of listings to be the exact same – with same title. (3)

Both: Some errors might not recover the website and either lose the listing or lose the class user was looking at.  

10. Help and documentation 

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 

Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. 
Example: help page, faq form, search, find out more – chat/online help, provide tour/training

Evaluation

Prototype 1:
* Need help center is only operational through Monday – Fridays from 9am-4pm, which means that outside of those hours, you just have to fill out a survey and can not get direct help. (3)
* It does not give any options or show you how to navigate the website at all. (3) 
* No FAQ or chatting online (2)

Prototype 2:
* Help option is not clear where it is located on web page – puts it on the bottom of the page where user cannot access it easily. (3)
* Help option is only pre-answered FAQ – there is no live person you can call to ask about it. (2)

Both: Does not have good access to help when user is stuck.
