## Documentation:

# Introduction: 
Myucla.edu serves as an information gateway for anything UCLA related and class planning website for students at UCLA. Myucla.edu provides many services for anyone that needs to find information about the school. The class planner specifically provides information on the different classes the student needs. 

UCLA students conducted an onsite usability test using a live version of myucla.edu located on the test administrator’s laptop. Two laptops using the Photobooth software captured the participant’s face and comments, while the Quicktime Screenrecording software captured the navigation choices and the live website. The test administrator and data logger were present in the testing room. The session captured each participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback.
